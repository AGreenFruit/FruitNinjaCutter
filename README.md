This project tries to cut fruit in Fruit Ninja (The first game).
This mainly uses cv2 to process and detect circles before using pyautogui to click and drag, cutting the fruit.
I used BlueStacks (https://www.bluestacks.com/) to emulate Fruit Ninja.

To run this program, launch Fruit Ninja through Blue Stacks and put the window in the upper left corner of the screen. Then run fruitninja.py.

Libraries needed:
numpy
cv2
mss
PIL
time
pyautogui
